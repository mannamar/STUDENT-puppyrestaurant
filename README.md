Main page- This page looks good at 1920, but I would make the picture under the text box a little shorter to better match the figma. Also i notice the burger picture isnt the same heigth as the text box to the right. Maybe a height 100% could fix that if you are using rows and cols. I would also suggest to remove the header image or scale it down when it gets to smaller screen sizes because it stays at a really tall height.

About me- the 1920 looks good the only think i would do is add some padding under the cards to have the little bit of white space that the figma has. The responsiveness could use some work. I notice that each card is a col, you can turn that col into a size 12 at a certain breakpoint to get them to stack on top of each other. you can also do the same thing for the top left photo of the dog, or you can hide it at a certain size since theres already a lot of photos.

Menu- the line spaceing is slightly to big and the fonts of the discription text under the entrees should be 20px. The our menu could also use a little padding on the top and bottom to get the white space on the figma. Also the our menu isnt lined up with the cards. I like the responseiveness but the text overflows the card around 1450 px range. maybe you can make the cards a col 12 a little bit to fix that. It is also missing the footer at 1920 but i like how it goes to the center at phone sizes. i think the footer also has to be lined up with the cards on 1920.

catering- I like the catering 1920 page it looks good. For responsiveness I suggest too get rid of some photos at smaller sizes and to line them up with each other. (fixed, took out some photos at smaller sizes 11/9/23 at 2:45pm)

phots- it looks good on 1920 but the photos header is a little too close to the top row of photos. also its like an exta pixel wide.  I would set a background color of white to the text to achieve something similar without the exta pixel width. All the photos disappear at 1080ish. (fixed photos at 1080px 11/9/23 at 2:32 pm, fixed closeness of header 11/9/23 at 2:24pm)

I know the footer is the right font but if you make it thin the underscores in the phone number will turn into - dashes like this. id ask a ta if thats fine or not. 

overall good job it just needs some tweaks and some responsiveness fixes.
